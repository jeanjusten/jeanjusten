<h2>:large_blue_diamond: About me</h2>

Im currently studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be a Fullstack developer.
In my previous area of work (Architecture) i was in touch with 3d modeling,
design and image rendering. It wasn't untill 2023 that i discovered a passion in
coding due to a personal side project in Game Maker Studio 2. Since then, i've been puting
all those skills to use and working hard to perfect HTML, CSS and JS.
